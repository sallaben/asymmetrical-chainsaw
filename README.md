## Installation

1. Install [Git LFS (Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/). You only need to do this one time per machine
2. Clone this repository *from the command line!* Your terminal will not receive any messages for an extended period of time during this process; don't worry, it's downloading shapefiles in the background.
3. Extract `data.zip` (located in the root project directory). You should end up with a directory structure like `./data/archive/...`
4. Open project.qgs using QGIS >=3.0

## Verified Environment
    QGIS 3.2.0-Bonn
